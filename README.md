# data_science_projects

In this repository, I upload analysis of different datasets asking different questions. 

Coffee Quality Analysis: I take two databases, merge and clean the data and analyse coffee qualities to see which factors contribute most to the overall quality of the coffee

Pitchfork Music Reviews: I take the scores of some artists according to their reviews and look for the best, the worst artist, how the music genres changed overtime and if the individual trends in the reviews are declining or increasing overtime for different artists
